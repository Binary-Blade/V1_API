# AgriFlow: My First Full-Stack Project

## Introduction
Welcome to AgriFlow, my inaugural project in full-stack development. I embarked on this journey with **zero prior experience in backend development** and managed to build the initial version of this project **entirely on my own in just four months**. 
Please note that the project is currently in **standby mode** and is far from complete.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Material UI
- **Backend**: Express.js

### Why Express.js on Backend?
Being completely new to backend development, Express.js offered a beginner-friendly environment to get things off the ground quickly.

## Features (Incomplete)
- **User Authentication**: Basic authentication flow.
- **Data Visualization**: Rudimentary charts and metrics.

## Technical Debt and Limitations
- **Code Quality**: The codebase lacks proper structure and comments.
- **Scalability**: The current architecture is not set up for scalability.
- **Best Practices**: The project does not adhere to best practices in either frontend or backend development.

## Future Plans
This project serves as a learning milestone, not the final destination. I am planning a complete overhaul, transitioning to NestJS for the backend and Next.js for the frontend, to align the project with industry standards.

## Note for Recruiters
For recruiters evaluating this project, it stands as evidence of my rapid learning capabilities and my ability to independently implement a full-stack application, all without previous backend experience. While the project remains in development and should be viewed more as a learning journey than a polished product, I am committed to enhancing both the project and my own skill set. I'm proactively seeking opportunities that will contribute to my growth and allow me to refine the project further.
